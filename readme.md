# Bangla Font Specifier

Bangla Font Specifier provides an option to choose from some popular Bangla fonts which will be set as default for any web page. If you don't see your favorite font in the dropdown-list, you can type the font name in the input box, then save it for future use. Remember, for any font to work fine, you must have the specified font pre-installed on your computer.
